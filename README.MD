<h1>Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project</h1>
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Loads the activity and feature info
2. Loads both the training and test datasets
3. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
4. Unifies data sets and improve column names
5. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `summarized-data.txt`.
